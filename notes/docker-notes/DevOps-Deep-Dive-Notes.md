## Day 1 ‚Äî Docker Best Practices

### 1. Reorder & Leverage Cache  
```dockerfile
# Before optimization
COPY . /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# After optimization
COPY requirements.txt /app/
RUN pip install -r /app/requirements.txt
COPY . /app
```
**Why?** Placing rarely-changing files first maximizes layer reuse on subsequent builds, speeding up iterative CI/CD runs.

---

### 2. Multi-Stage Builds
```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.20 AS builder
WORKDIR /src
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp

FROM alpine:3.18
COPY --from=builder /src/myapp /usr/local/bin/
ENTRYPOINT ["myapp"]
```
**Why?** Removes compilers and build tools from the final image, keeping it lean and secure.

---

### 3. Pin Base Image by Digest
```dockerfile
FROM python@sha256:3a8f3‚Ä¶e5f2
```
**Why?** Ensures you always build against the exact same OS and runtime, avoiding unexpected drift and vulnerabilities.

---

### 4. Combine & Cache-Bust RUN
```dockerfile
RUN set -o pipefail && \
    apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y curl && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```
**Why?** Creates a single layer, always fetches fresh packages, and avoids stale cache issues.

---

### 5. Enforce Fail-Fast in Pipes
```dockerfile
RUN set -o pipefail && wget http://example.com/file | tee /tmp/log
```
**Why?** Guarantees the build fails if any piped command errors, preventing silent failures.

---

### 6. JSON-Form CMD
```dockerfile
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
**Why?** Avoids shell-wrapping issues and makes it easier to override the command at runtime.
